# Hackathon
This project was developed during a sustainability-themed hackathon competition within 24 hours. With the foresight that water will become increasingly valuable in the future, we designed a system that monitors water consumption and rewards users for conserving water. This solution aims to encourage individuals to use water more consciously and to raise awareness on a societal level.
